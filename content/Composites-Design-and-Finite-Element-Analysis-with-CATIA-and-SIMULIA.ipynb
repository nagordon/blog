      "**Summary.** This example utilizes the CATIA Composites Design workbench and the Elfini workbench to create a composite part with material properties, ply stacking, and ply orientation and perform a ply level stress analysis to determine at which pressure and location failure is expected.\n",

      "\n",
      "The panel ([figure](#fig:panel)) is a composite laminate composed of two seperate materials. The panel is clamped on all four edges, eliminating the rotational and translational degrees of freedom, and a pressure is applied normal to the undeformed surface. It is expected that the elongated hole will likely be a stress concentration of the panel, but it is not clear what pressure the laminate is capable of supporting. However, this information will be ascertained by performing the analysis using the Elfini Finite Element workbench in CATIA. From these results, the location and plies that are at highest risk of failure will be identified using the tsai-hill composite failure criterion, and with that information, design changes can be implemented to reduce the stress and risk of failure. \n",

      "One of the challenges when designing with composites is that, due to the typical complexity of a composite part, the part design and simulation results can be difficult to visualize, and choosing the correct design parameters required to properly define the part is often unclear. A ply table is a simple way to understand how the composite is constructed. The table shown in ([figure](#fig:plytable)) shows how the composite is organized with ply number, material, and orientation. The ply table can be used interactively with the 3D model to look at the ply properties. The plys of interest for this example are highlighted in orange. These plys are on the top and bottom and cover the entire composite and make up the elongated hole, which is the expected maximum stress of the laminate. There are a total of 5 plies that make up the elongated hole, 3 on top (Ply.37,35,36)  and 2 on the bottom (Ply.33,34)\n",

With these assumption, we can assume that ply.34 will be the highest risk ply, and by inspection, ply.34 does indeed have the highest stress of all the plies.

However, failure of a composite often occurs first to a ply, and since plies can have various stresses due to potentially differing material properties and loading states, the local ply stress must be determined and corroborated to the material strength to determine if ply failure is anticipated. The failure criterion commonly used for composites is the tsai-hill [[Daniel2006]](#Daniel2006). The tsai-hill criterion is adapted from the von-mises criterion, which is defined as failure when the material yields. Typically, long-fiber composites are transversely isotropic.
